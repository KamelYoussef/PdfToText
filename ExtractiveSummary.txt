The document is an acknowledgment and summary of a study conducted in the field of tax policy, particularly focused on income-based tax incentives within the OECD area and beyond. The authors express gratitude to individuals from the OECD Centre for Tax Policy and Administration for their support in conducting surveys related to tax policy. The surveys were conducted as part of the peer review process of preferential tax regimes by the OECD Forum on Harmful Tax Practices (FHTP) of the Committee on Fiscal Affairs, as well as in collaboration with other relevant initiatives.

The content is divided into several sections, including acknowledgments, introduction, availability of income-based tax incentives, rationale for implementation and impact of OECD BEPS (Base Erosion and Profit Shifting) action, key design features, and a conclusion. The study discusses the availability and characteristics of income-based tax incentives in various economies, their design, and the impact of international tax policy efforts like the BEPS project.

Key findings include the prevalence of income-based tax incentives in various jurisdictions and their diverse characteristics. The study highlights that such incentives are often implemented to promote research and development (R&D) and innovation activities, as well as to encourage the commercialization of intellectual property (IP) within the jurisdiction. The study also notes that many of these tax incentives have undergone evaluation through the peer review process of the FHTP, which monitors their compliance with international standards.

Throughout the document, figures and tables provide visual representations of data related to income-based tax incentives, including key characteristics, qualifying IP assets, IP income distribution, tax rates, and more. The study underscores the importance of understanding these incentives' design and impact on business practices and economic growth.

The authors also indicate the limitations of their study, including data sources and geopolitical considerations. They clarify that the data and information used in the study predate certain events, like Russia's aggression against Ukraine in February 2022.

In conclusion, the document highlights the significance of understanding income-based tax incentives and their various features in the context of international tax policy efforts. The study emphasizes the importance of transparent and responsible tax policies in promoting economic growth and fair competition.

The document discusses a study conducted by the United States Government Accountability Office (GAO) in December 2022, focusing on abusive tax schemes and the efforts of the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) to detect and deter promoters of such schemes. The GAO found that while the IRS is actively investigating various abusive tax schemes involving small businesses and certain self-employed individuals, there are areas for improvement in terms of external referrals and the IRS's plans for improving promoter investigations.

The study reveals that the IRS is currently engaged in numerous investigations involving a variety of abusive tax schemes, and these investigations are being conducted by different units within the IRS. However, the GAO suggests that the IRS could enhance its external referrals related to suspected abusive tax schemes. It recommends that the IRS improves communication and guidance to the public on how to report information about abusive tax scheme promoters. The GAO also advises the IRS to finalize its goals and performance measures to better achieve its plans for improving promoter investigations.

The study provides insights into the general process of conducting a civil promoter investigation, involving identification of promoter leads, case management, planning, investigation startup phase, identification of participants, fact gathering, penalty phase, report assembly, and closure. It explains that these processes vary slightly based on the IRS's operating divisions conducting the investigations.

The document highlights the creation of the IRS's Office of Promoter Investigations (OPI) and its mission to strengthen the IRS's response to abusive tax avoidance transactions by detecting and ending the promotion, organization, and sale of abusive tax transactions. The OPI's goals are centered on protecting taxpayer rights, equitably enforcing tax laws, and providing taxpayers and stakeholders with information on how to protect themselves against fraudulent schemes.

However, the study notes that there have been recent shortcomings in IRS communication efforts. Specifically, the annual "dirty dozen" list, which alerts the public to abusive tax schemes, no longer includes information on how the public can refer information about promoters of abusive tax schemes.

The GAO recommends that the IRS make necessary amendments to its communications, particularly the "dirty dozen" list, to inform taxpayers about how to report information on promoters and preparers involved in abusive tax schemes. The study suggests that clear communication and guidance are crucial for enhancing the effectiveness of IRS efforts to detect and deter abusive tax schemes.

Appendices provide further details, including identified IRS webpages and forms for referring information on tax noncompliance, IRS responses to the GAO's recommendations, and contact information for GAO staff involved in the study.

In summary, the GAO's study highlights areas where the IRS's efforts to detect and deter abusive tax schemes could be further strengthened, primarily through improved communication and guidance to the public and within the IRS itself. The report emphasizes the significance of clear communication and effective coordination in combatting abusive tax practices.
