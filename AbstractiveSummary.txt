In the spring of 2021, a special collection was introduced, focusing on embracing digital transformation in incremental steps. The collection highlighted the importance of moving towards digital mastery and the competitive advantages offered by digital technology. The authors, Didier Bonnet and George Westerman, emphasized the need for companies to develop both digital capability and leadership capability to succeed in the digital era.

The collection revisited the elements of digital transformation proposed in 2014. While the core elements of leadership capability remained unchanged, the elements of digital capability were profoundly altered due to rapid technological advances. The new elements included improving customer experience, internal operations, and employee experience. Additionally, the rise of multisided platform businesses and the importance of data platforms in digital innovation were recognized.

Creating compelling customer experiences was identified as a critical factor in gaining a competitive edge. This required a combination of empathic creativity and technological prowess to design and deliver experiences that resonate with customers. Companies like Sephora and Huntington Ingalls Industries exemplified successful digitally powered customer experiences.

Furthermore, the authors emphasized the significance of digital platforms, APIs, and data analytics in transforming business models and fostering openness. Agile methodologies and eliminating internal silos were also highlighted to enhance speed and agility when working with digital partners.

Overall, the collection emphasized the urgency for companies to embrace digital transformation and become digital masters. The increasing complexity of digital technology and the widening gap between digital masters and their competitors made it crucial for companies to take concrete steps towards digital transformation.
