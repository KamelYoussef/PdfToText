The spring 2021 special collection titled "Moving Towards Digital Transformation: Embracing Digital Mastery" explores the evolving landscape of digital technology and its potential for creating competitive advantages. Authored by Didier Bonnet and George Westerman, the collection emphasizes that digital transformation is not an all-or-nothing process and can be achieved incrementally.

Over the past decade, digital transformation has become increasingly complex, driven by advances in technologies like the internet of things, artificial intelligence, virtual and augmented reality, and 5G. Successful digital transformation requires companies to develop both digital capability and leadership capability, enabling them to use innovative technologies to improve their businesses and drive organizational change effectively.

The collection revisits the elements of digital transformation proposed in 2014, highlighting the need for strong leadership capabilities such as vision, engagement, and governance. However, the elements of digital capability have undergone significant changes due to rapid technological advancements. Some elements have been reconfigured, while new elements have emerged to reflect the opportunities and impact of new digital technologies.

Customer experience remains a central focus of digital transformation. To create compelling experiences, companies need a balance of empathic creativity and technological expertise. Experience design involves tools like journey mapping, ethnographic studies, and customer personas, along with practices like design thinking, to understand customer behaviors and insights better. Digital reengineering integrates front-office technologies with back-office infrastructure for seamless service delivery.

Furthermore, the rise of multisided platform businesses, such as Alibaba, Amazon, and Google, has expanded the elements of business model innovation. Companies can harness platform economics to transform their business models and leverage algorithms using unstructured data to enhance customer experience and internal operations.

Leadership that fosters openness, agility, and data-driven decision-making is crucial for successful digital transformation. Businesses must eliminate internal silos, adopt agile methodologies, and leverage data analytics to work effectively with digital partners. The adoption of APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) facilitates openness and collaboration within and outside the organization.

The authors emphasize the significance of digital platforms, which underpin all other elements of digital transformation. Companies must develop enterprise-wide capabilities to make APIs easily consumable and integrate with various platforms to remain competitive in the digital age.

Overall, the collection underscores the urgency for companies to embrace digital transformation and become digital masters to stay ahead in a rapidly evolving landscape. Digital mastery requires a combination of technical expertise, innovative thinking, strong leadership, and a customer-centric approach. By leveraging digital technologies and embracing change incrementally, businesses can transform and thrive in the digital era.
