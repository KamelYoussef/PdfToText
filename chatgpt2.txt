The paper discusses different approaches for modeling temporal dynamics in recommender systems. It focuses on two major temporal effects: user biases, which change over time, and single-day effects, which capture fluctuations in user ratings within a day.

The authors propose two main techniques: linear modeling and spline modeling. The linear modeling involves using linear functions to represent time-changing user biases and single-day effects, while the spline modeling employs spline functions for the same purpose.

The paper presents a time-sensitive baseline predictor that combines the linear or spline models of user biases and single-day effects. It also introduces a factor model that captures longer-term trends and temporal changes in user preferences.

The study demonstrates that properly considering temporal dynamics improves the accuracy of recommender systems, especially when dealing with movie rating datasets. The authors show that the drift in user biases has a more significant impact on accuracy than temporal movie effects.

Overall, the paper contributes to the methodology and techniques for effectively modeling time-changing user preferences in recommender systems, leading to enhanced recommendation accuracy.
